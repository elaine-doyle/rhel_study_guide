#ISCSI

INTRO
=====
iSCSI: Internet Small Computer System Interface 
iSCSI is a tcp/ip based protocol for emulating high performance local storage over IP networks.

ADVANTAGES
==========
= can be used over wide distances
= provides location independent data storage retrieval using distd servers and arrays
 
CONCEPTS
========
INITIATOR: server using the storage remotely (server1)
YUM SW required: iscsi-initiator-utils

TARGET: server where storage is provisioned from (server2)
YUM SW required: targetcli

ACL: initiators are tied to targets, acls used for this 
iSCSI uses ACL’s to provide LUN masking which manages accessibility to the target

LUN: Logical Unit that is provisioned as storage, made available to a target (through a portal IP)


PORTAL: Usually IP of the TARGET where the storage is provisioned from but refer to either initiator or target

TPG: Target Portal Group: A set of IP’s and ports that the target will listen on

IQN: Identifier, similar to WWN, iSCSI Qualified Name
Naming Format:   IQN.YYYY-MM.com.reversed.domain:[optional]

node: iSCSI target or initiator

discovery: process of querying a target server to list available storage/targets

login:  to use storage (or initiate block device use) on the initiator you need to use -l to login



OTHER NOTES
============
= targetcli is an interactive shell & a command-line utility, it supports tab completion & has a directory hierarchy.

= There are 4 types of storage you can configure with iSCSI, these are called BACKSTORES
  - BLOCK DEVICE (disk drive/partition/vol group etc) 
  - FILEIO (vm disk images)
  - PSCSI (physical SCSI passthrou)
  - RAMDISK

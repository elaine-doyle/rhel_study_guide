#EMAIL


INTRO
=======
= Null Client is a machine that runs a local mail server which forwards emails to 
an outbound mail relay for delivery
= Previously /usr/sbin/sendmail => now in RH7 => postfix


TRANSMISSION OF AN EMAIL MESSAGE
===============================
= mail client-> talks to outgoing mail server
= ms -> relays that msg to the mail server using SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
= Outbound mail relay may require NO auth from internal clients => server listens on 25/tcp
= in essence the mail server is restricted to only hosts that can send through any IP restrictions on the FW
= OB mail relay -> looks up DNS MX record
= sends email to mail server in that record (server must accept email for the recipients domain)
= relay uses SMTP on port 25/tcp to send the email to that server

POSTFIX
=========
= a package (install via yum)
= files /etc/postfix/main.cf (main config)
= master file /etc/postfix/master.cf (controls what sub-services are started)


IMPORTANT POSTFIX CONFIG SETTINGS
================================
M - myorigin                       (if someone generates a mail on this host ensure you tag it as coming from this server)


M - mydestination 		   (what domains am I mail server endpoint for)
				   Default: $myhostname, localhost

M - mynetwork                     (allow mail to relay through this server if coming from defined comma separated IPs)
 			           ** if not defined in main.cf default is mynetworks_style = “subnet” => change to “host”
			           Default: mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8

R - relayhost	  		  (forwards to this mail server for emails not destined for my domain)
				   ** [] around the value suppresses DNS MX lookup 
				   Default: relayhost = 

I - inet_interfaces 		  (controls what Interfaces postfix listens on)			  
				  ** can be ‘all’  ‘localhost’, can be 1/more hostnames/IP’s whitespace separated  
			 	  Default inet_interfaces = localhost			 

L - local_transport = 		  (determines what happens to local bound mail)
				  Default: local_transport = local:$myhostname (delivers to /var/spool/mail)
				  Can set to “local_transport = error: local delivery disabled


QUERY POSTFIX
===============
#postconf <value>
 e.g. #postconf relayhost inet_interfaces local_transport
# cat/vim /etc/postfix/main.cf
Where references to $value in the file => variables

EDIT POSTFIX
============
#postfix -e ‘setting = value’
#postfix -e ‘my origin = example.com’
#systemctl reload postfix

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
# tail /var/log/maillog
# postqueue -p/-f


TO ACT AS A NULL CLIENT WHAT IS NECESSARY
==========================================
1) local delivery of mail is turned off
2) mail send to an outbound relay for delivery
3) users on the null client CAN run a mail client to send/read emails

NULL CLIENT Example SETTINGS
==========================
#postconf -e ‘myorigin=desktop10.example.com’
#postconf -e ‘mydestination=‘ 
#postconf -e ‘mynetworks=127.0.0.0/8 [::1]/128’
#postconf -e ‘relayhost=[smtp10.example.com]’
#postconf -e ‘inet_interfaces=loopback-only’
#postconf -e ‘local_transport=error: local transport disabled’

Check config
#postconf
#systemctl restart postfix


VERIFY CONFIG by EMAILING test EMAIL
=====================================
#mail -s “Server10 null client” student@desktop10.example.com
Client TEST
EOT

Check mail arrival using “mutt”
#mutt -f imaps://imap10.example.com
username/password
m for mail

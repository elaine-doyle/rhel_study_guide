EXERCISE
========

REQUIREMENTS: allow sshd to bind to new port (999/tcp)
protect it using a firewall rule, allow in ‘work’ zone
Route all connections from 172.25.1.0/24 through work zone 
Port 999/tcp should also be available in the work zone

1. Verify sshd is available on 22 & 999
# ss -tupln | grep sshd
Restart sshd to check the config
# grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config


2. Tell SELINUX you want to bind 999/tcp to sshd
Note: This command is in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# semanage port -l | grep sshd (you get the port label ssh_port_t)
Add port label of type ssh_port_t to port 999 which will be used over protocol tcp
# semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 999


3. Update the firewall config for the default/working zone to allow connectivity over port 999/tcp
Allow connections from your other (fictitious) network
# firewall-cmd -—permanent —-zone=work —-add-port=999/tcp
# firewall-cmd —permanent —-zone=work —-add-source=172.68.10.2/24


4. Restart/reload services
systemctl restart sshd
firewall-cmd -—reload


5. To test
ssh -p 999 root@yourhost

TLS: Transport Layer Security for encryption of traffic between client/server


CREATING TLS CERTS
==================

*** Install crypto-utils package to use the cert generation tool: genkey
# yum install -y crypto-utils
# genkey FQDN
key size 2048

A number of files are generated in /etc/pki/tls

1. /etc/pki/tls/private/fqdn.key
This is the private key, should not be shared anywhere
Should have 0400 perms
Should have cert_t SELINUX label/context

2.  /etc/pki/tls/certs/fqdn.0.csr
This file is generated if you specified that you are going to CA for cert authority signing. You send this to the CA.

3.  /etc/pki/tls/certs/fqdn.crt
This its he returned file from CA
This also could be generated if you choose: self-sign
This is the PUBLIC CERT
Should have perms 0644
Should have cert_t SELINUX label/context


HTTPD needs SSL_MOD module to extend functionality to include TLS
=================================================
Will automatically enable httpd to listen on 443
Default virtual host config is in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Lots of new stuff thereâ€¦have a look at one
SSLEngine on 		** turns on TLS for this virtual host
SSLCipherSuite		** says which encryption ciphers will be used

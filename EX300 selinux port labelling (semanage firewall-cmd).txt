All network ports need to have the correct SELINUX label/type
This section deals with labels on ports ONLY

=======================================================

Packages: policycoreutils
	  policycoreutils-gui (which installs the necessary selinux-policy-devel

Man Pages: mandb (after installing the above
	man -k _selinux | grep http (or just list all)
	semanage
	semanage-port
	system-config-selinux

GUI: system-config-selinux

=======================================================

Network traffic is tightly enforced by the SELinux Policy.
E.g : Policy=targeted
port 22/tcp has label ssh_port_t

When a process wants to listen on that port, selinux checks to see if the label associated with that process is ALLOWED to bind that port label.

Security Adv: Stops rogue services taking over ports (which should be used by legit services)

Port labeling is VERY important when an administrator uses a non standard port to run a service.

sometimes the relating policy already has a label associated with certain ports.
e.g. 8008/tcp is sometimes used as an alternative port….and this already has the selinux label http_port_t associated with it.


TO LIST PORT LABELS
===================
semanage port -l

LIST PORT LABELS FOR http
===================
semanage port -l | grep http
Note: a label shows up for udp & tcp ports

Show local changes: semanage port -l -C


TO ADD A PORT TO AN EXISTING LABEL TYPE
=======================================
# semanage port -a -t port_label -p tcp <port#>
e.g.
# semanage port -a -t gopher_port_t -p tcp 71


MODIFY a PORT LABEL
====================
# semanage port -m -t http_port_t -p tcp 71


EXERCISE: 
=========
Web application (new) is running on 82/tcp - a non-standard port… Permit connectivity & content being served here from your desktop…
So whats needed.
- bind port using selinux (think semanage and port label…http_port_t) to 82/tcp
- restart httpd
- use firewall-cmd to open port 82/tcp on your firewall for http in the permanent confutation

1. Get correct port label
# semanage port -l | grep http

2. Assign the port label (if not already done)
# semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 82

3. Restart httpd
# systemctl restart httpd

4. Add firewall cmd & reload
# firewall-cmd —-permanent -—add-port=82/tcp
# firewall-cmd —-reload
